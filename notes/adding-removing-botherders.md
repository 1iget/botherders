Botherders are included in the following:

* Conservancy's list of project members (Buildbot Oversight Committee) - email
  `buildbot@conservancy.org` to inform them of changes.
* The `core` group on the `buildbot` github organization
* The `botherders` mailing list (https://lists.buildbot.net/mailman/admin/botherders)

When removing botherders, it is also sensible to consider:

* Infra admins - https://github.com/buildbot/buildbot-infra/blob/master/group_vars/all#L15
