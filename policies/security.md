Security Policy
---------------

If you find a vulnerability in Buildbot, contact one or more of the Botherders, listed at https://github.com/buildbot/botherders, or all of the Botherders at `botherders@buildbot.net`.
You should expect an immediate confirmation of your email, and reasonably frequent updates as to the progress of the investigation and fix.

Note that Buildbot has no full-time developers, so the timeline for remediation may be longer than would be expected from a formal organization.
