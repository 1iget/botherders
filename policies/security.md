Security Policy
---------------

If you find a vulnerability in Buildbot, contact all of the people in MAINTAINERS.txt under "Security". You should expect an immediate confirmation of your email, and reasonably frequent updates as to the progress of the fix.

Note that Buildbot has no full-time developers, so the timeline for remediation may be longer than would be expected from a formal organization.
