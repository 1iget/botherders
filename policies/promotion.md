Casual Buildbot contributors can do their work without any particular permissions: patches can come via pull requests, tickets can be filed with a simple registration, and anyone can help out on IRC or the mailing list.
Buildbot developers, however, deserve both formal recognition of their position and an easier process for contributions

Commit Rights
=============

Permission to push to http://github.com/buildbot/buildbot and the associated repositories is granted by membership in the "Developers" group in the organization.
Developers will receive notice of all pull requests on github, and are expected to review and merge patches in addition to their own development.
Developers also have the strongest voice in setting direction for the project.

To be given commit rights, a contributor should have an established history of well-constructed patches and be willing to make a long-term commitment to the project.
Dustin makes the final determination of who will be given commit rights, but the recommendation of any other developer is very persuasive.

Component Maintainer
====================

Component maintainers are expected to respond to bugs related to a component by providing additional information or fixing them.
Component maintainers need not be Python programmers, but should be very familiar with the component and be willing to spend time working with the developers to keep that component functioning properly.

Any developer can add a component maintainer simply by adjusting the records in version control.
Developers and maintainers should recruit as many maintainers as practical.
If a maintainer must "retire", and they are the last maintainer for a component, they are expected to find a replacement.
Maintainerless components do not last long!

Trac Admin
==========

Trac needs a lot of handholding, and anyone who can help out by triaging bugs, keeping wiki pages up to date, and handling administrative issues like user accounts and spam, is a great help to the project.

Dustin can grant additional permissions in Trac on an as-needed basis.
Ask via email or in IRC.

Buildbot.net Admin
==================

It's worthwhile to have a number of folks who can tend to the metabuildbot and otherwise keep things up to date.

And of the admins on this system can grant others access to the 'buildbot' account via SSH key.

IRC Voice (+v)
==============

The "+" prefix to nicknames in IRC indicates someone who has demonstrated a commitment to supporting other users.
It doesn't grant any additional capabilities, but serves as a recognition of their contribution.

Dustin, or anyone with ops in the channel, can add this flag.
Nominations by others in the channel (via PM) are appreciated.
