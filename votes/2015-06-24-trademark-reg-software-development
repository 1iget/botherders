I'm proposing that we adopt Tony's second suggestion, which includes the $225
to register Buildbot as software that we just approved.  So this is an
additional $225 (for a total of $450) to register Buildbot as a Software
Development Service

- $450 to register the trademark in two classes (re: software and re:
software development services)

Opposed: Dustin Mitchell, Pierre Tardy
