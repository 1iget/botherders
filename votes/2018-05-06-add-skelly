Sean has been around the project for half a decade, working a bit on the code but mostly on the infrastructure.  He's shown good judgement and long-term thinking in that process.

In the interest of keeping the botherders list "fresh", I'd like to propose that we add Sean as a member of the Botherders group, as already briefly discussed on this list.
