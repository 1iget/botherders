Botherders --

As discussed in a previous email thread, I will be stepping down as Buildbot
maintainer after the 0.9.0 release.  In preparation, I have asked Bill Deegan
if he is willing to serve as Representative to Conservancy, and he has agreed.
I'd like to make this change now, rather than waiting for the release.  Per our
agreement with Conservancy, this change requires a majority vote, after which I
will inform Conservancy.

Please reply with "yea" or "nay" per our decision-making process.

----

PASSED
In favor: Pierre Tardy, Bill Deegan, Dustin J. Mitchell, Amar Takhar, Tom Prince
