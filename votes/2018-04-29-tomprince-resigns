I move to recognize Tom's resignation from the botherders[*] and additionally commend him for his incredible work on the project over the last 9 years.  Tom has an amazing attention to detail and strong sense of design[+], both of which contributed to making Buildbot a much more regular, predictable piece of software.

Per the bylaws, please reply with your votes.

[*] I don't think the bylaws require this, or provide for us to reject anyone's resignation, anyway
[+] This is among the reasons I'm really glad Tom works at Mozilla now :)

PASSED
In favor: Pierre Tardy, Bill Deegan, Dustin J. Mitchell
