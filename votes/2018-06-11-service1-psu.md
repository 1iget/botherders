Thanks Amar!

As background, this is for the server service1 from ix systems, which went down a few weeks back with a bad power supply.  Replacing the power supply should allow us to return it to service.

We've never decided how we will decide to spend money, so a vote seems like the obvious choice.

Please vote!

    Hey everyone!  Apologies for the long delay on this it was my fault I had my own
    little misunderstanding on pre/post approval for funds.

    Please find attached the cost of the power supply.  Shipping is free since I'm
    getting it added into an RTEMS RMA that we are getting this week.

    The cost is very fair I think at $130.


    Amar.
